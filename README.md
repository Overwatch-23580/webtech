LIFEBANK

Project Identification

Life Bank is a user-friendly website designed to facilitate the process of blood donation. Its primary objective is to connect donors with blood donation events and provide a platform where donors can track their donations over time.

The website features a comprehensive interface that allows users to view upcoming blood donation events. Donors can browse through the list of events, including details such as date, time, location, and any specific requirements or instructions. By providing this information, Life Bank helps individuals plan their donation schedules conveniently.

When a donor attends a blood donation event, the attending doctor or medical professional uses the Life Bank system to record the donation.
 This ensures accurate documentation and creates a digital record of the donor's contribution. The recorded information typically includes the date and time of the donation, the quantity of blood donated, and any additional relevant medical data.

Life Bank assigns a unique user account to each donor, which they can access to view their donation history. Upon logging into their account, donors can see a summary of their previous donations, including the dates and quantities of blood donated. This feature provides donors with a sense of accomplishment and allows them to keep track of their ongoing contribution to saving lives through blood donation.

In addition to the donor interface, Life Bank also includes an administrative panel. The admin has the authority to create new blood donation events and manage the overall system. They can add event details, such as event name, location, date, and any specific requirements for potential donors. The admin also has the ability to add or remove doctors from the system, ensuring proper coordination between medical professionals and the blood donation events.

Doctors play a crucial role in the Life Bank system as they are responsible for recording the donations made by donors. Using their assigned accounts, doctors can access the system and record the relevant information after each blood donation. This process ensures accurate data collection and maintains transparency in the system.

Overall, Life Bank provides a streamlined platform for blood donation events, making it easier for donors to find and attend events and enabling them to monitor their donation history. By digitizing the process, the system ensures efficient record-keeping and allows for better coordination between donors, doctors, and event organizers. This ultimately promotes a culture of regular blood donation and contributes to saving lives through the availability of a sufficient blood supply.
